The provided `bug.js` file doesn't contain the error; the error is in the environment configuration. This solution focuses on resolving environmental issues.   Here's how to systematically approach fixing the problem:

1. **Check the error message:**  The exact error message is key. It will point to the specific missing Android SDK component.
2. **Verify ANDROID_HOME:**
   - Ensure the `ANDROID_HOME` environment variable is set correctly in your system's environment variables.  It should point to the root directory of your Android SDK installation.
3. **Verify JAVA_HOME:**
   - Ensure that `JAVA_HOME` points to your Java Development Kit (JDK) installation directory. The JDK is required for Android development.
4. **Check PATH:** Make sure the `platform-tools` and `build-tools` directories (within your `ANDROID_HOME` directory) are added to your system's PATH environment variable.  This allows the Expo CLI to find the necessary executables.
5. **Open Android SDK Manager:**
   - Open the Android SDK Manager (usually accessible through the Android Studio SDK Manager or command line). 
   - Carefully examine the list of packages and install any missing or outdated components indicated by the error message, including build-tools and platform-tools.  Pay close attention to the version numbers required by your Expo project.
6. **Restart your machine:** After making environment variable changes, restart your computer to ensure they take effect.
7. **Clean and rebuild:** In your terminal, run:
   ```bash
expo prebuild
expo run:android
```
