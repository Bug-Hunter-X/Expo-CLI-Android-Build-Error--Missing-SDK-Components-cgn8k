This error typically arises when the Expo CLI cannot find or access the necessary Android SDK components.  This might be due to incorrect environment variables, an improperly configured Android SDK, or missing dependencies.  The exact error message will provide more clues, like a specific missing SDK tool or path.  Here's a code snippet that *might* be involved (but the error isn't in this specific code, but in the environment setup):

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import {Text, View} from 'react-native';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Open up App.js to start working on your app!</Text>
    </View>
  );
}
```
