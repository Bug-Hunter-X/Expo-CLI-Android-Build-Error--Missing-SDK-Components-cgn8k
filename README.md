# Expo CLI Android Build Error: Missing SDK Components

This repository demonstrates a common issue when building Android projects with the Expo CLI: errors related to missing or improperly configured Android SDK components. The error message is not consistent; its exact phrasing will depend on what's missing.

## Problem

The Expo CLI build process fails because it can't locate or access essential Android SDK tools or packages.  This usually results in an error message indicating a missing path or component.

## Solution

The solution involves verifying the Android SDK installation, ensuring necessary environment variables are set correctly, and resolving any missing dependencies.

1. **Verify Android SDK Installation:** Check that the Android SDK is installed and that the `ANDROID_HOME` environment variable is correctly set to point to the SDK's root directory. Also, ensure the SDK's `platform-tools` and `build-tools` are up-to-date.
2. **Check Environment Variables:** Confirm that JAVA_HOME is set correctly. Your Android Studio installation likely includes the required JDK. If it doesn't you may need to download the JDK directly from Oracle. 
3. **Install Missing Components:** Use the Android SDK Manager to install any missing SDK packages or platform tools mentioned in the error message.
4. **Restart and Rebuild:** After making changes, restart your terminal and try the Expo build process again.

## Additional Notes

* The specific error message is crucial for identifying the exact missing component. Always include it when seeking help.
* Consult the Expo documentation for the most up-to-date instructions on setting up the Android development environment.
